# Symbolically Executable Stack Machines in Rust
Symbolic Stack Machines is a library for implementing symbolically executable stack-based virtual machines.

This works by providing various traits for a `Stack`, `Memory` (including read-only and writeable memory), `VMInstruction`,
as well as generic `Val` structure to represent stack or memory values. Finally, it provides a set of abstract `Machines`
which can be instantiated with a specific instruction set and can execute a sequence of instructions concretely or symbolically.

Implementing a new VM involves, simply, implementing the `VMInstruction` trait for an enum that describes the instruction set of the
operations.

Each operation should output a state diff (`ExecRecord`), which describes the updates to the stack, memory, any new path constraints (in the case of symbolic execution), and machine's program counter. The machine can apply the update with `ExecRecord::apply`.

# Reachability

The Machine constructs the updates performed on its state by instructions. Operations can add path constraints via the ExecRecord structure. The Machine incrementally constructs a set of constraints for each possible path of execution. Once these paths are constructed, the machine checks whether such paths are reachable. See `src/machine/mod.rs`, specifically, the `BaseMachine::run_sym` method for the implementation.

Currently, there is no intermediate path pruning performed.

# Supported Memory & Stack Models
Currently, two forms of symbolic memory are built-in: Memory based on the theory of arrays, and finite concrete memory that can store possibly symbolic values.

The only built-in stack model right now is a finite stack that can store symbolic or concrete values.

The only symbolic values that have built-in support right now are integers.

# Usage
See `lib.rs` for a toy instruction set and its symbolic execution.

# Open Questions
- How to handle endianness of various machines w.r.t bit vectors?
- Best approach for modular plug-and-play style machine creation (storage, mem, stack, etc)?
- How to handle special, niche environments? E.g., EVM has GAS opcode which requires a notion of gas within the machine.
- Copy on write when storing machine states?
-

- Niche exec environments:
    - Optional undefined context;
    - Pass this as an implicit argument to VMInstruction::Exec
    - Opcode author is responsible for writing the interaction
    - ExecRecord is extensible by this generic context as well



# Notes 
1. Type constraints on Machine to ensure that the values stored on stack are convertible to the val type stored in memory as well as the val type used to index the memory
2. Remove direct z3 dependency and generate an IR + transformation from IR -> target (e.g., smtlib2, rust-z3 bindings)
3. For niche exec environment, provide custom context definition and access on the machine
4. Add a generic context switch method; useful for describing behavior of one program calling another (such as smart contract calls)
